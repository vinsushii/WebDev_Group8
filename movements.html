    <h1>Movements</h1>
<p>
  Throughout history, racism has denied people their dignity, rights, and
  opportunities. In response, communities across the world have organized
  powerful movements to challenge discrimination and demand justice. These
  movements have shaped societies, changed laws, and inspired new generations to
  continue the fight against racism.

    <p>
      The abolitionist movement was one of the earliest global campaigns against
      racism. Activists in Europe and the Americas fought to end the
      transatlantic slave trade and slavery itself. Leaders like Frederick
      Douglass and Harriet Tubman spoke out against the cruelty of slavery and
      inspired others to join the fight for freedom.

    <p>
      In the United States, the Civil Rights Movement worked to end racial
      segregation and secure equal rights for African Americans. Through peaceful
      protests, marches, and legal action, leaders like Martin Luther King Jr.
      and Rosa Parks pushed for change. This movement led to the Civil Rights
      Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, landmark victories against
      racism.

    <p>
      In South Africa, apartheid laws enforced strict racial segregation. The
      anti-apartheid movement, led by figures like Nelson Mandela and Desmond
      Tutu, fought against this injustice. After decades of resistance, apartheid
      was abolished in 1994, and South Africa held its first multiracial
      democratic elections.

    </div>
    <p>
      The Dalit movement in India challenges caste-based discrimination, which
      has historically treated Dalits (formerly known as “untouchables”) as
      inferior. Inspired by leaders like Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, the movement calls
      for equality, dignity, and social reform, linking the fight against
      casteism to the global struggle against racism.

    <p>
      Black Lives Matter (BLM) began in 2013 after the killing of Trayvon Martin
      in the United States. It quickly grew into a global movement against police
      brutality and systemic racism. Using social media and mass protests, BLM
      has brought attention to racial injustice and continues to inspire
      activism worldwide.
